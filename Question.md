### Questions about Slack
- There are problems with my slack account, it doesn't work right now. Having trouble loading my workspace

- Is there any other way to get contact?

- I use Skype as well, my account is live:ayumi919

- And Dmitrij's work is very good, much more structural, and I really like it. Just a pity small suggestion, have you considered to use BEM in your class names? Or maybe now everything is for test purpose, and you have considered it. Anyway, that is just some small details. Just come into my mind, never mind about it.

- I tried something by myself, and if I understand right, FETCH seems work like this "fetch('http://example.com/movies.json')", fetch get HTTP response. So I use Dmitrij's JSON-file link in Github  
fetch('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dmitrijv/fend19-js2-project/master/json/inventory.json')
And it seems work fine, easy to generate all 10 items.

- I also like the way you designed about how to increase items number, bacause why I did is quite silly. I need to write how many items I need on the left - the items area - then click add button, then all information shows on the right. But your way is easy to make some small adjustment, very nice.
